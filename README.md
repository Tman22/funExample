# FunList!!

This application was built using `create-react-app`
After you clone this down
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start`
  - `npm test`

### Expectations / Rules

Build a React App that displays *fun events*!

You will have a 40 minutes to build this application. Whatever you don't finish in the mock assessment, we recommend you practice prior to the final assessment.

***When you create a component you MUST also create a test file. You must test as you go.***

### Iteration 0

Walk through the mockup and outline the components that you will need to build this application.

Pull down the [API repo](https://github.com/rrgayhart/fun-parser) and get it up and running. Read over the README.

### Iteration 1

**Note: You may not leave any tests that already exist broken**

**Note: You must add tests for new components**

Using fake data, create the ability to submit an event

And the ability to show all events

### Iteration 2

Replace your fake data with the actual API: https://github.com/rrgayhart/fun-parser

Remember that you will need to run your tests and ensure that they are still hooked up

You can use [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) to come up with fake event content if you want!

### Iteration 3 (extension)

Pair with your evaluator to create a custom endpoint and hit it with your frontend

Example might be - adding a delete endpoint and then giving yourself to the ability to delete an event
